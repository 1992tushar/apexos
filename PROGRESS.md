# ApexOS — Build Progress

## Where the build came from

- **2026-07-19 (session `1b3999ee`, run from `C:\Users\tthopte`):** Built ApexOS end-to-end in one
  autonomous run. Produced the full `docs/` design set (Phase 0), the base scaffold, the initial
  Alembic migration, then fanned out two parallel agents ("backend spine" + "frontend spine") that
  wrote all the code under `apps/api` and `apps/web`.
- **Where it stopped:** during **E2E run/verify**. No Docker on this machine; PostgreSQL 18 is
  installed but `initdb` refused because the shell ran under an **admin token**. The API stream then
  timed out and the session died. **Result: all code was written but never run or verified.**
- **2026-07-20 (this session, run from the project folder):** Recovered the history, resumed the
  unfinished E2E verification.

## Environment (this machine)

- Python 3.12.7, Node 24 — OK. **No Docker.** PostgreSQL 18 installed (binaries only, at
  `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18`), no cluster, no service.
- **Admin-token gotcha:** Postgres refuses to run under an elevated token. Fix that works:
  run `initdb` / `pg_ctl start` via a **Windows Scheduled Task with `/RL LIMITED`** (forces the
  standard non-admin token). `runas /trustlevel` is NOT enough — the bootstrap child still sees admin.
- **Throwaway DB cluster:** initialized in the session scratchpad, **port 5433**, user `apex`,
  trust auth, db `apexos`. This is disposable — see "How to bring the DB back up" below.
- `apps/api/.env` and `apps/web/.env.local` are written pointing at port 5433 / API 8000.

## Status by area

- [x] Design docs (`docs/00`–`17`) — complete
- [x] Backend code (`apps/api`) — all modules written: identity, customers, products, pricing,
      inventory, sales, fulfillment, finance, dashboard, activity, config
- [x] Frontend code (`apps/web`) — app shell + spine pages (dashboard, customers, products,
      inventory, sales list/new/detail, finance)
- [x] Backend deps installed (venv + `pip install -e ".[dev]"`)
- [x] Web deps installed (`npm install`)
- [x] Postgres cluster up (5433) + `apexos` db created
- [x] Alembic migration applied (33 tables)
- [x] Seed data loaded (17 products, 3 customers, 1 order → invoice → part-payment)
- [x] API runs + endpoints verified (E2E backend) — reads, writes, and the full
      order→confirm→fulfill→invoice→payment workflow all return 200 with real data
- [x] Web builds/typechecks + runs — all 10 routes serve live API data, no runtime errors
- [x] Bugs found in audit fixed; **final smoke test green (every page HTTP 200)**

## ✅ E2E VERIFIED — 2026-07-20

The unfinished work from the 2026-07-19 session is complete. The whole stack runs and is verified.

### Bugs found & fixed during E2E (frontend/backend contract drift between the two build agents)

1. **`next.config.mjs`** — removed `experimental.typedRoutes`. It's incompatible with the
   data-driven nav (routes as data, `[module]` catch-all) and blocked the build on every shared
   component. (Confirmed by the frontend audit as the correct fix.)
2. **`apps/web/src/app/(app)/finance/page.tsx`** — `GET /invoices` returns a plain array, but the
   page treated it as a paginated `{items}` envelope → `.reduce` on `undefined` → 500. Now fetched
   as an array.
3. **`apps/web/src/app/(app)/sales/[id]/page.tsx` + `lib/dto.ts`** — backend `SalesOrderDetail`
   serves flat `customer_id`/`customer_name` and **arrays** `fulfillments`/`invoices`; the page
   expected a nested `customer` object and singular `fulfillment`/`invoice` → 500 on
   `order.customer.id`. DTO + page realigned to the real contract (uses `[0]` of each array; also
   `fulfilled_at` → `shipped_at`).
4. **`apps/web/src/features/products/products-table.tsx`** — removed `rowHref` to `/products/[id]`
   (no such route exists; it dead-ended at the `[module]` placeholder).

Backend audit was clean; only a non-blocking Dockerfile layer-ordering nit remains (see below).

## How to run it (verified working on this machine)

**1. Bring up Postgres** (only if `pg_isready -p 5433` fails — see recipe below).

**2. Backend** (from `apps/api`):
```
./.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m alembic upgrade head      # if DB is fresh
./.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m app.seed                  # if DB is empty
./.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```
Docs at http://localhost:8000/docs · OpenAPI at http://localhost:8000/api/v1/openapi.json

**3. Frontend** (from `apps/web`): `npm run dev` (or `npm run build && npx next start -p 3000`) →
http://localhost:3000

## Known non-blocking follow-ups (not needed to run)

- `apps/api/Dockerfile`: `pip install -e .` runs before `COPY . .`, so the editable package has no
  source at build time. Reorder for container builds. Local run is unaffected.
- `duration-[120ms]` Tailwind class is ambiguous → harmless build warning.
- Products have no detail page (`/products/[id]`) yet — by design (not in the spine).
- Nav modules marked `active: false` (Categories, Warehouse, Procurement, POs, Suppliers, Reports,
  Analytics, Tasks, Documents, Settings) render the "coming soon" placeholder — future work.

## How to bring the DB back up (new session)

The cluster lives in a session-scratchpad dir that may be cleaned up. If `pg_isready -p 5433` fails,
re-create it with the LIMITED-scheduled-task trick (init in a user-writable dir, `-U apex -A trust`,
set `port = 5433`, `pg_ctl start`, `createdb apexos`). See this session's commands for the exact recipe.

## Next steps

1. `alembic upgrade head` → `python -m app.seed`
2. `uvicorn app.main:app` → curl `/health` and `/api/v1/dashboard/summary`
3. `npm run build` (web) → `npm run dev`, verify pages load against the API
